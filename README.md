- 👋 Hi, I’m @M-Kusumgar

- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering and development. I like to automate things and take the tedium out of life. I have a project where I am trying to code a program for the school I am working for which will automatically set students personlised homeworks based on what they struggle with in A Level Maths and Further Maths.
 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Angular and ReactJS and developing example apps for those.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my maths questions module which will contain templates of A Level Maths questions written in JS and LaTeX.
